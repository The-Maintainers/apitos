> How a Creative Commons model for API Terms of Service participate in the creation of open, safe and sustainable ecosystem for digital infrastructure   ?

## Project overview 

The trust in the “as-a-service” digital infrastructure (Eghbal, 2016) economy (often called API economy) has been broken many times because of opaque API terms of service (ToS), or unexpected changes and disruption. That can be the case of Twitter APIs (Taina Bucher, 2013), Netflix APIs, Facebook APIs, Linkedin APIs, Google APIs and so many others. 

More open, transparent API terms of services contracts will build an open and safe digital infrastructure where the application can know automatically in what terms the API and the data and the service behind, can be used or not (Vukovic, Laredo, Rajapogal 2014) , helping to solve many technical, compliance and/or business rules. This applies as for governments, public sector, non-profit, science and education, or business.
But today, API ToS are built by a legal team while APIs are consumed by developers and business terms are designed by marketing people, that brings a lot of confusion in answering the question: Can we use this API ? Even more, lots of questions remain unsolved: can we reuse data collected through the API? Can we reuse our implementation of the specification in connexion with other APIs?
APITos-CC project aims to make API ToS more understandable by all stakeholders by generating a framework (“Creative Commons” like) with a nice and efficient User Interfaces for business owners, developers, users and other stakeholders involved. 

Our hypothesis 
- The terms of service for APIs represent a boundary object whose identification of specific clauses and degree of "openness" (on the model of Creative Commons licenses with different degrees of conditions of use) can work towards a better understanding and vigilance regarding the constitution of open, secure and sustainable digital infrastructure ecosystems.  
- Working with the various stakeholders involved in the definition of ToS (lawyers), their implementation (developers) and their valuation (services) is key to better understand the adoption of new uses and the operationality of this model.
