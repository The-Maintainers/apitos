# API Terms of Service : towards a Creative Commons model ? (APIToS-CC)


> How a Creative Commons model for API Terms of Service participate in the creation of open, safe and sustainable ecosystem for digital infrastructure   ?

## Project overview 

The trust in the “as-a-service” digital infrastructure (Eghbal, 2016) economy (often called API economy) has been broken many times because of opaque API terms of service (ToS), or unexpected changes and disruption. That can be the case of Twitter APIs (Taina Bucher, 2013), Netflix APIs, Facebook APIs, Linkedin APIs, Google APIs and so many others. 

More open, transparent API terms of services contracts will build an open and safe digital infrastructure where the application can know automatically in what terms the API and the data and the service behind, can be used or not (Vukovic, Laredo, Rajapogal 2014) , helping to solve many technical, compliance and/or business rules. This applies as for governments, public sector, non-profit, science and education, or business.
But today, API ToS are built by a legal team while APIs are consumed by developers and business terms are designed by marketing people, that brings a lot of confusion in answering the question: Can we use this API ? Even more, lots of questions remain unsolved: can we reuse data collected through the API? Can we reuse our implementation of the specification in connexion with other APIs?
APITos-CC project aims to make API ToS more understandable by all stakeholders by generating a framework (“Creative Commons” like) with a nice and efficient User Interfaces for business owners, developers, users and other stakeholders involved. 

Our hypothesis 
- The terms of service for APIs represent a boundary object whose identification of specific clauses and degree of "openness" (on the model of Creative Commons licenses with different degrees of conditions of use) can work towards a better understanding and vigilance regarding the constitution of open, secure and sustainable digital infrastructure ecosystems.  
- Working with the various stakeholders involved in the definition of ToS (lawyers), their implementation (developers) and their valuation (services) is key to better understand the adoption of new uses and the operationality of this model.

## Methodology 

The project will combine a first phase to define an APIToS framewok by conducting a set of interviews of API owners and stakeholders in order to prepare a legal analysis of existing API. During a second phase, we will  co-design with the API practitionner a prototype an API ToS pre-designed package. 

           A one year project with 
           Phase 1 : Pilot Phase for API ToS framework
               Interview of API owners and stakeholders
               Legal analysis of existing API and main issues
           Phase 2 : Prototype API ToS pre-designed packages (co-designed)
               Co-design with the API practitioner community
               Stabilize the API ToS framework

## An open science approach : 

This project is included in open science principles by taking care to open up the data and research process so that it is “as open as possible” while respecting an ethical framework and the protection of participants (privacy, economic secrecy, etc.). We will ensure that we use FAIR standards and provide digital workspaces that facilitate the reproducibility of quantitative analyses (jupyter notebook, docker, etc.). Our publication will be published in open access journal or an archive (HAL, Zenodo) and will tend to publish our pre-print. and all our work will be usable in free and open source licences, in order to be accessible, editable and reproducible by other researchers.
