## Methodology 

The project will combine a first phase to define an APIToS framewok by conducting a set of interviews of API owners and stakeholders in order to prepare a legal analysis of existing API. During a second phase, we will  co-design with the API practitionner a prototype an API ToS pre-designed package. 

           A one year project with 
           Phase 1 : Pilot Phase for API ToS framework
               Interview of API owners and stakeholders
               Legal analysis of existing API and main issues
           Phase 2 : Prototype API ToS pre-designed packages (co-designed)
               Co-design with the API practitioner community
               Stabilize the API ToS framework

## An open science approach

This project is included in open science principles by taking care to open up the data and research process so that it is “as open as possible” while respecting an ethical framework and the protection of participants (privacy, economic secrecy, etc.). We will ensure that we use FAIR standards and provide digital workspaces that facilitate the reproducibility of quantitative analyses (jupyter notebook, docker, etc.). Our publication will be published in open access journal or an archive (HAL, Zenodo) and will tend to publish our pre-print. and all our work will be usable in free and open source licences, in order to be accessible, editable and reproducible by other researchers.
